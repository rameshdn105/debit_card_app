$ if((Get-FileHash -Path actions-runner-win-x64-2.321.0.zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToUpper() -ne '88d754da46f4053aec9007d172020c1b75ab2e2049c08aef759b643316580bbc'.ToUpper()){ throw 'Computed checksum did not match' }
# Extract the installer
$ Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ; [System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD/actions-runner-win-x64-2.321.0.zip", "$PWD")
